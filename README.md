## A Felix Lottery Sample Contract

:warning: This Code Was Not Audited Yet: Mainnet usage requires extreme caution

In this repository we have a simplified version of the core functionality powering the Felix Lottery Platform.

For more info on how Felix Lottery works, you can find the documentation here: [docs](https://docs.felixapp.xyz).

The Felix Platform is live on [testnet](https://preview.felixapp.xyz) and [mainnet](https://www.felixapp.xyz).

# Bounty

As part of our security efforts, we're bootstrapping a Bug Bounty Program. Bugs & Exploits responsible disclosured will be compensated. As the platform grows, the bounty grows.
